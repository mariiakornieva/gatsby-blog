description: I am starting my blog
---

Welcome to my blog!

I am so excited to embark on this journey. I have a lot of things to share and I believe the best way to learn new things is to teach others.
So on my blog I am going to share what I already know and what I've just started learning.

This quote by Richard Feynman perfectly describes the aim of learning by teaching when you need to explain the underlying concept of something:

> I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. - R.Feynman

Hope you'll find useful what I have to share!

Have a nice day wherever you are in the world!
