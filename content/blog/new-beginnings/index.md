description: I am starting my blog
---

Welcome to my blog!

I am so excited to embark on this journey. I have a lot of things to share and I believe the best way to learn new things is to teach others.
So on my blog I am going to share whar I already know and what I've just started learning.

This quote by Richard Feynman perfectly describes the aim of this blog:

> I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. - R.Feynman

Hope you'll find useful what I have to share!

Have a nice day wherever you are in the world!
